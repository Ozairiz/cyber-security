## Proof of Exploitation (POC) of  <REPLACE-with-Vulnerability-Description>
---
<!-- The POC title should be the vulnerability in what software or protocol, Example Proftpd mod_copy -->

The vulnerability was exploited through the following steps below.
- Vulnerability Scanning to identify that target <IP-or-hostname> is vulnerable to <CVE-ID> which is <Description-of-vulnerability>
- Use of <Tool-used> to validate that the vulnerability is exploitable
- Demonstrated that the vulnerability affecting <IP-or-Hostname> is indeed exploitable.


## Steps to Reproduce

<!--NOTE:The steps to reproduce section aims to provide guidance how a vulnerability is discovered and exploited use grammar as 3rd person 

### Vulnerability Scanning & Discovery

### Vulnerability Exploitation
<!--NOTE:This section is the final evidence of exploitation is a section to place final evidence such as..." -->

<!-- SPIEL: The VAPT consultant <YOURNAME> demonstrated the exploitation of the vulnerability by using metasploit/ or exploit  ...." -->

<!-- NOTE: The section should add the final evidence explaining impact such as having interactive shell access or administrative access -->
